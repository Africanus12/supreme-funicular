# Weather Map

This is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that displays a map with weather data for selected cities. 

## Features

- See a map with annotations for predefined major cities
- Tap on a city annotation to see the current temperature
- Day/night mode toggle to switch between light and dark themes
- List view showing all cities and their current temperatures
- Detail views for each city with extended forecasts

## Implementation 

This app uses:

- SwiftUI for the UI and views
- MapKit to display the city map annotations
- CoreLocation to get geographic data
- Combine framework to manage state
- MVVM architecture and observable objects

Some key classes:

- `CityViewModel` - Fetches and stores weather data for cities
- `MapView` - Displays a map with city annotations  
- `CityDetail` - Shows additional weather data for a city

## Getting Started
